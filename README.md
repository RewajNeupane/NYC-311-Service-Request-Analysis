# NYC-311-Service-Request-Analysis
Analyzed the “Customer Service Requests from 2010 to Present” dataset to extract insights from over 300,000 NYC 311 complaints. The project focused on preparing, cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset to identify service delays and spatial complaint patterns. Key tasks included datetime conversion, missing value handling, new column creation, and irrelevant column removal. Using visualization and statistical methods (ANOVA & Chi-square), the project revealed how complaint resolution times vary across complaint types and locations.
